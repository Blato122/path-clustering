## Progress:
### 13.11.2025:
- exploring COeXISTENCE repos, learning to use JanuX
### 20.11.2025:
- enriched feature generation
### 27.11.2025:
- downloaded osm files for Ile-de-France cities (instead of using Andorra for testing).
- changed path generation approach with Janux - instead of calculating a path for each OD
        pair, we now only do it for the OD pairs specified in agents.csv files. This allows for
        a massive speed up, reducing the number of generated paths per city from tens of thousands
        to the order of hundreds.
- generated routes and enriched feature routes for all Ile-de-France cities using JanuX.
- added many new features (bearing_std, pct_paved, num_turns, ...)
- refactoring
- fixed some bugs
- added a basic clustering script
### 04.12.2025 (no meeting):
- added new features (such as circuity)
- refactoring + comments clarifying feature enrichment 
- fixed data duplication bug
- added normalzation of some features
### 11.12.2025:
- experiments with clustering the paths and visualisation
- reaserch about multi objective clustering
- trying rearenging the clusters so that each agent has one path per cluster
- trying weighted feature clustering for clearer clusters naming


osm folder - osm files for Ile-de-France cities

data folder - sumo generated xml files + OD pairs for IdF cities

results - outputs from the scripts (routes - generated by janux, merged_edges - sumo and osm features, enriched_routes - routes joined with merged_edges)
